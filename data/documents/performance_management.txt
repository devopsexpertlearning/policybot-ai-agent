TechCorp Solutions
Effective Date: January 2026

1. INTRODUCTION

TechCorp Solutions is committed to fostering a high-performance culture through continuous feedback, development, and recognition. This policy outlines our performance management framework, evaluation processes, and career development opportunities.

1.1 Philosophy
We believe that:
- Performance management is an ongoing dialogue, not an annual event
- Employees deserve clear expectations and regular feedback
- Development and growth are mutual responsibilities
- Recognition should be timely and meaningful
- Performance directly impacts compensation and career progression
